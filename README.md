# dactyl
Scripts and utilities for parsing logs

Just run `python dactyl-cli.py`. Note, this was developed for python2 (probably will not work w/ 3 yet).

Make sure the script is in the same location as your .npz data files (a dirty hack for now).

You have 3 commands:
1. New figure - create a new window to put signals in
2. New subplot - put a new signal in the last window you created
3. Display - show the results
